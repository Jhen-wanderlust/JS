# Algorithm is always depends on two things. The programmer should know exactly what he have and what he want
# So he need to see the combinations between them make an algorithm
#i explain now wait   

# for example i wanted this page result to get all categories  ok 
# and observing this link i can have this info for all categories   
# I have tried 2 3 times and i found out that the app works ok also like this right? jhen? jhen? you there? 
#the app should loop on all cat , but its ID not class
# whatever it is but this is true that its there. now the guy should make a way to make it work like that
#if i manage to get this value then i can create links for each right?m yes#algorithm is important make this thinking instead to writing not working code ok 
# i spend all time thinking making the algo and only 5 minute to write it
